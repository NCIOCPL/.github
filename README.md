## Shared Workflows
The .github repo contains things that can be shared across multiple repositories. Shared workflows get a bit complicated, so for now we have stored them as branches, but nothing in the default branch since the default branch is the default for everything. (Everything is issue templates, default labels, etc)
 
### "Workflow"
This is our shared configuration management workflow that lives in the [workflows/v2](https://github.com/NCIOCPL/.github/tree/workflow/v2) branch.
